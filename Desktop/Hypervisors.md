# üñ•Ô∏è Virtual Machines  
**Level:** Intermediate

---

## üöÄ Introduction  
Virtual Machines (VMs) are virtualized/emulated environments that allow you to run an entire operating system as if it were a separate physical computer. This means you can:

- Run **Linux on Windows/macOS**
- Run **Windows on macOS**
- And much more ‚Äî the use case is completely up to you

They‚Äôre great for development, testing, sandboxing, or simply exploring other operating systems without changing your main setup.

## üîë Key Notes  
- Your system **must have virtualization enabled in the BIOS/UEFI** to use VMs effectively.  
- If **virtualization is disabled**, you may experience:
  - Poor performance  
  - Hypervisors failing to launch  

> üîç Manufacturers differ ‚Äî virtualization may be **enabled or disabled by default**, so it's your responsibility to check. This guide does **not** cover how to do that.
