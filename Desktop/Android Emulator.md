# 📱 Android Emulators  
**Level:** Beginner – Intermediate

---

## 📘 Introduction  
Android emulators are tools that let you run Android OS on your PC or macOS system. They simulate Android devices, allowing you to play mobile games, test apps, or use mobile-only apps directly on your desktop.

They are commonly used by:
- Mobile gamers (for better performance and controls)
- App developers (for debugging & testing)
- Users who want to access Android features on non-mobile platforms

## 🔑 Key Notes  
- Most Android emulators run on top of virtualization tech (VT-x / AMD-V), so make sure **virtualization is enabled in your BIOS/UEFI**.  
- Some emulators may install additional drivers or services — always download from official sources.  
- Performance varies greatly depending on your hardware (CPU/GPU/RAM).
